## What's `football.db`?

A free open public domain football (soccer) database & schema
for use in any (programming) language
(e.g. uses plain text datasets for match schedules, results and more).
More [`football.db` Project Site »](http://openfootball.github.io)


## Intro

Free open public domain football datasets include:

- [**Argentina**](argentina) - Primera Division
- [**Brazil**](brazil) - Brasileiro Série A
- and others



## Build Your Own `football.db` Copy

Try in your working folder (that is, `/south-america`):

```
$ sportdb build
$ sportdb --verbose build     # or for more (verbose) details incl. debug info
```

This will

- setup a new single-file SQLite database e.g. `./sport.db`
- read in all datasets in plain text (`.txt`)

That's it.
